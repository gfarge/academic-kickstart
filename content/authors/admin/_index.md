Seismic signals recorded on surface of the Earth offer glimpses of geophysical
processes that are often not directly accessible by other means of observation.
They inform us on the time scale, energy release and geological conditions
constraining the observed phenomenon. From icequakes to low-frequency
earthquakes, from volcanic tremor to turbulent flow and sediment transport in
rivers, I am interested in studying the physics of geological processes using
the seismic signals they generate.
